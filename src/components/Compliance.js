      <h4>Deliver trust</h4>
        <p>
        It’s more important than ever for business to deliver on trust ‒ and tax compliance is a critical driver of trust. Reporting taxes transparently, in the face of complex and differing business goals and stakeholder demands, is the mark of a business that wants to earn and deliver trust.

        <h4>Higher quality and transparency</h4>
